        <p>The Alert Program was developed by Occupational Therapists to teach children self-regulation and to teach adults how to support learning, attending and positive behaviour in children.</p>
        <p>It uses the analogy that the body is like a car engine sometimes running <i>too high</i>, sometimes <i>too low</i> and sometimes <i>just right.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Participation in the Alert Program will provide the child and adults with a common language and words to describe how the child's <i>engine is running. </i>It will also provide a range of simple, low-budget strategies and activities that can be incorporated easily into the home and into school routines, in order to assist the child with feeling <i>just right.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy has enhanced the Alert Program by adding additional visual support and interactive cue cards, to support children with special needs.</p>
