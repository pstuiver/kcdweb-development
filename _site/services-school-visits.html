        <p>Classrooms are often louder, brighter and busier than the individual or small group sessions at Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy. For this reason it is valuable for the therapist to perform a school visit in order to observe the child in the classroom setting as well to as establish lines of communication with the child&#39;s teachers or educational support staff.</p>
        <p>By request, Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy is able to perform school visits during weekday mornings. School visits are billed according to the time spent at the school plus a nominal cost for travel to and from the school.</p>
        <p>During the school visit the therapist will monitor, assess and assist with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The child&#39;s ability to transition between activities.
