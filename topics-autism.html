        <p>At Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy we understand not only the importance of early ASD intervention but also the impact that ASD can have on the entire family.</p>
        <p>As no two children on the spectrum are the same, great care is taken to develop aims and targets that are specific to each individual child and family’s needs.</p>
        <p>Therapeutic intervention is thus focussed on family involvement and education in order to generalise skills to the home environment and to ensure sustainability of the recommended programs.</p>
        <p>In order to provide a multidisciplinary approach, Elsje Stuiver is experienced in working and communicating with other health care practitioners that might be providing additional therapeutic services to ASD clients.</p>
        <p>Elsje Stuiver is also trained and experienced in addressing the following areas that are typically associated with ASD:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Language and communication</strong>: Although this area also requires specialised support from speech and language therapists, Elsje Stuiver&#39;s knowledge in Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) will support your child’s ability to communicate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Social interaction: </strong><a class="whitetext-bluebg" href="services-skills-dev.html" target="_self">Skills development</a> Sensory Integration, DIR and other behavioural techniques are used to promote awareness of clients to themselves and others, appropriate social responses, behaviours in public spaces and tolerance to change. </li>
                <li>

                    <strong>Sensory Integration difficulties:</strong> <a class="whitetext-bluebg" href="services-sensory-int.html" target="_self">Sensory Integration</a> techniques are used to address the child’s behaviour, emotional responses, focus and attention. This may include the implementation of a <em>sensory diet and/or alert program</em> or alternatively addressing the child’s motor planning and sensory processing skills.
