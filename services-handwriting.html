        <p>In order to develop a legible, fluent and fast handwriting style, children first need to develop the foundational skills required to become successful in handwriting.</p>
        <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy offers individual and group sessions focused on developing the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Attention and concentration</b> - The ability to remain focused for a sustained period of time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Balance and postural control</b> - Able to sit alone, use their arms to hold a crayon or pencil and not to support the trunk to stay upright.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Shoulder stability</b> - Stabilise the shoulder to reach and support the forearm, wrist and hand when holding a pencil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fine motor skills</b> - Accurately moving and controling the muscles of the hands and fingers
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bilateral coordination</b> - The ability to use both hands together. One to stabilise the paper and the other to lead the writing action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Eye hand coordination</b> - Coordinating the movement of arms, hand and eyes so that they will work together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Letter perception</b> - Including the ability to recognise forms, notice likeness and differences, infer the movements necessary for the production of a form and to give accurate verbal descriptions of what is seen.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ocular motor control</b> - Controlling the muscle movements in our eyes for smooth tracking during copying or reading tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Proprioceptive feedback</b> - The sensory system that unconsciously tells us where our body parts are in space even if we are not visually monitoring them. This is necessary to attain a correct pencil grip as well as to use adequate pressure when writing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Motor planning</b> - Forming a plan in our brain and sending accurate messages to our muscles to perform the plan.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In conjunction with addressing the above-mentioned areas, Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy offers two handwriting programs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Write start program</b> - Teaching methods for developing accurate letter formation, sizing, placement and spacing in print-style writing.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Write Smart program</b> - Teaching methods to increase the accuracy of letter formation, fluidity of handwriting, speed and legibility in cursive style writing.
            </li>
        </ul>
