        <p>In order to achieve maximum gains from therapy, Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy recognises the importance of parent, guardian and care-giver involvement in the intervention process. Emphasis is placed on helping parents understand the different areas which may boost or hamper their childâ€™s development.</p>
        <p>The therapist&#39;s specialised training and experience enables her to provide the family with strategies, handouts, equipment and other resources to best support the child in achieving their full potential.</p>
        <p>After the
            <a class="bluetext-whitebg" href="services-ot-assessment.html" target="_self">Occupational Therapy Assessment</a> and before commencing the therapy process, the parents, child and therapist will be provided with opportunity to collaborate on setting the goals for therapy.</p>
        <p>This goal-setting process ensures that there will be realistic expectations and tangible outcomes on which to measure the success of the therapy intervention.</p>
        <p>In addition, each therapy session incorporates a 5-10 minute collaboration between family members and the therapist and opportunity for the therapist to provide recommendations with regards to home practice and repetition.</p>
        <p>On request, Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy is also available for private parent meetings as well as community and school presentations on Occupational Therapy or related topics.</p>
